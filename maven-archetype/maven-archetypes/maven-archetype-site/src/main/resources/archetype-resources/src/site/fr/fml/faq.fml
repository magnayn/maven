      <question>D'où vient Maven</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Maven was created by a group of software developers who were tired
          of wasting their time fiddling around with builds and wanted to get
          down to brass tacks and actually develop software!

      <question>Pourquoi Maven est-il si populaire?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Maven saves you so much time in your software development efforts that
          you will have time to learn a second language, relax ten hours a
          day, and train for that marathon you've always wanted to run!
