        Maven is a Java project management and project comprehension tool. Maven
        is based on the concept of a project object model (POM) in that all the
        artifacts produced by Maven are a result of consulting a well defined
        model for your project. Builds, documentation, source metrics, and source
        cross-references are all controlled by your POM. Look here to see the
        full list of Maven's <a href="features.html"><b>features</b></a>.
