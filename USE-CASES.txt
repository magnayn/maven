Trying to get a large set of use cases that we can use to help drive
development in the right direction. I would like to collect some here and then
post them to the wiki as examples users can template to express what their
use cases are. So my first example is something I chatted about with Aslak
this morning. So they are brief and possibly naive but a huge collection
of these would help I think.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Being able to write artifact handler that would operate to install an
xdoclet plugin correctly when an xdoclet plugin is stated as a dependency.

- With Maven installed it should be a simple command that allows you to
checkout the sources for a project.

- Unified source directory structure that is analagous to the repository
itself. This way locations of intermediary artifacts of a build would be
in a known location.  This would also help with developer setup i.e. getting
new developers up and running. They could run a maven command and have all
their source trees set up in the same way as their collegues.
