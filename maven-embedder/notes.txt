When you create the assembly you must manually install it in your
local repository for now in order the maven-embedder-it tests to
work. jvz.

-- parse xml to in-memory model
  Now MavenEmbedder.readProjectWithDependencies()
  transitively resolve all dependencies and download them
  if anything is missing. 
  
-- we need a callback for progress indication:
   download, build, etc

-- run m2 (embedded): including running building, archetypes, etc.

-- introspect available plugins and their goals
  
-- to generate source folders for eclipse project from m2 pom.xml
   we need to run generate-sources phase, so all plugins
   registered for this phase will be kicked of and will register
   target folders for compilation.
   Ideally it would be nice to ask these plugins for the target
   folders, but Brett said it will be only in 2.1, so I guess
   we'll have to actually run these plugins and generate code.

-- In order to nicely show all the errors and events in the IDE UI
   We need to have two messages for EACH event/error:
     -- the short description (in Eclipse it can be used in Problems view)
     -- detailed description (can be used in annotation/editors markers)

-- Need getters for MavenEmbedder properties. E.g. to retrieve default 
   location of the local repository
