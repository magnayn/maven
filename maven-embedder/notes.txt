- surefire needs to feed into the logging
- maven/plexus archiver needs to be fixed

-- to generate source folders for eclipse project from m2 pom.xml
   we need to run generate-sources phase, so all plugins
   registered for this phase will be kicked of and will register
   target folders for compilation.
   Ideally it would be nice to ask these plugins for the target
   folders, but Brett said it will be only in 2.1, so I guess
   we'll have to actually run these plugins and generate code.

-- In order to nicely show all the errors and events in the IDE UI
   We need to have two messages for EACH event/error:
     -- the short description (in Eclipse it can be used in Problems view)
     -- detailed description (can be used in annotation/editors markers)

-- What are all the settings that must be provided? Ones that can be set
   and what the default values would be if they aren't set.
