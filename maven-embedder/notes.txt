o need to check in changes to plexus, maven-core, embedder
o task segment still using the wrong logger

x child container
x mojos need to feed into the logging
- surefire needs to feed into the logging

When you create the assembly you must manually install it in your
local repository for now in order the maven-embedder-it tests to
work. jvz.

-- run m2 (embedded): including running building, archetypes, etc.

-- introspect available plugins and their goals
  
-- to generate source folders for eclipse project from m2 pom.xml
   we need to run generate-sources phase, so all plugins
   registered for this phase will be kicked of and will register
   target folders for compilation.
   Ideally it would be nice to ask these plugins for the target
   folders, but Brett said it will be only in 2.1, so I guess
   we'll have to actually run these plugins and generate code.

-- In order to nicely show all the errors and events in the IDE UI
   We need to have two messages for EACH event/error:
     -- the short description (in Eclipse it can be used in Problems view)
     -- detailed description (can be used in annotation/editors markers)

-- What are all the settings that must be provided? Ones that can be set
   and what the default values would be if they aren't set.

-- Need to make an input handler to IDE use soon.

-- having to add all the component descriptors by hand and the maven
   version metadata is a real drag. something needs to be added to
   the assembly plugin.

-- maven.home

this is a CLI notion and should not be required by the embedder but
we still need to deal with notions of centralize configuration which
are extremely important in the corporate environment.

-- ~/.m2

plugin registry and settings should be stored in the tool specific locations

-- local repository will be shared and default to ~/.m2/repository

<jdcasey> you know something else that would rock for the eclipse plugin? if
F5 triggered a re-resolution of the poms, and recreation of the .classpath, etc.
<jdcasey> that way, if the pom was upgraded to the next version-SNAPSHOT,
you'd get it
<jdcasey> :)
<jdcasey> configurable on|off, of course
<jdcasey> F5 is refresh, BTW
