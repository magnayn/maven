Guide to using attached tests

 Many times you may want to resuse the tests that you have created for a project in another. For example if you have
 written <<<foo-core>>> and it contains test code in the <<<${basedir}/src/test/java>>> it would be useful to package
 up those compiled tests in a JAR and deploy them for general resuse. To do this you would configure the
 <<<maven-jar-plugin>>> as follows:

+----+

<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
     <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
       <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
       <executions>
         <execution>
           <goals>
             <goal>test-jar</goal>
           </goals>
         </execution>
       </executions>
     </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>

+----+

* Installing the attached test JAR

 In order to install the attached test JAR you simply use the standard install phase by executing
 the following command:

+----+

mvn install

+----+

* Deploying the attached test JAR

 In order to deploy the attached test JAR you simply use the standard deploy phase by executing
 the following command:

+----+

mvn deploy

+----+

* Using the attached test JAR

 In order to use the attached test JAR that was created above you simply specify a dependency on the main
 artifact with a specified type of <<<tests>>>:

+----+

<project>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.myco.app</groupId>
      <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>tests</type>
    </dependency>
  </depdendnecies>
  ...
</project>
