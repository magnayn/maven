Your First Plugin

  This section of the document walks the reader through the process
  of building a simple plugin which takes no parameters and simply
  displays a message on the screen when run.  It covers the basics of
  setting up a project to create a plugin, the minimal contents of a
  Java mojo, and the means to cause the mojo to be executed.
