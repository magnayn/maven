    <section name="Development Road Map for Maven 2.0">
      <p>
        This document discusses the release plans and current roadmap for Maven 2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are working to a 4-5 week release cycle, meaning that there will be at least one release per month.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first releases such as the technology preview will be designated "alpha" releases, indicating that
        they are not yet feature complete and there are outstanding bugs. Following that, "beta" releases will be
        made available where introduction of new features will be restricted and the focus on improving usability and
        stability. Finally, one or more release candidates will be distributed for testing that are genuinely believed
        to be final, with the expectation that a final release would be available shortly afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will continue with the successful technique from Maven 1.0 of making plugins available on a separate
        release schedule so that new features can be obtained as they are ready and tested.
      </p>
