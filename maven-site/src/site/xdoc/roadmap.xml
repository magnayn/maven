    <section name="Development Road Map for Maven 2.0">
      <p>
        This document discusses the release plans and current roadmap for Maven 2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that we will continue with the successful technique from Maven 1.0 of making plugins available on a
        separate
        release schedule so that new features can be obtained as they are ready and tested.
