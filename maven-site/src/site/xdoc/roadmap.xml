      <p>
        This document discusses the release plans and current roadmap for Maven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that we will continue with the successful technique from Maven 1.0 of making plugins available on a
        separate
        release schedule so that new features can be obtained as they are ready and tested.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Maven 2.0.x">
        <p>
          <i>Aims and features:</i>
          Bugfixes found in the Maven core will be released as interim updates leading up
          to the Maven 2.1 development stream.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Maven 2.1">
        <p>
          <i>Aims and features:</i>
          Features to be added after the freeze on Maven 2.0 will be slated for a 2.1 release in 2006.
