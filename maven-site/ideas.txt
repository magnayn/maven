   Our current URL looks like:
   scm:cvs:pserver:@cvs.host.name:/cvsroot:module-version
   
   Using this URL, the default is to connect to the CVS server using the
   same userid as the current user.  This is the desired behavior and I
   don't want to mess that up.  I just would like a means to add a userid
   in the URL only in special circumstances like Continuum.

   specify a ${user} and take it from the environment and allow an override.
