Maven plugins
 
 Maven plugins are comprised of any number of {{{mojos.html}mojos}} which are simple classes that
 perform a single action and goals that are a parameterized execution of a mojo.

 Goals can also be a different parameterization of the same mojo. 

 This definition could certainly be refined and cleaned up with some examples
 and diagrams.
