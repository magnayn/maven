Maven Model
 
 This is strictly the model for Maven, so really just plain objects.
 Eventually I would like to be able to generate these from a UML model but that can
 come later. In addition to generating the sources from a UML model I would
 like to generate the XSD or any other artifacts that may be required. This way
 we can keep things up-to-date instead of the disaster we have with the
 current incarnation of Maven.
