Maven Model
 
 This is strictly the model for Maven, so really just plain objects.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * Java sources (will link to javadoc later)

   * Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser

   * A {{{maven.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An XSD (link to it when available)
