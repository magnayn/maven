This document outlines some of the steps that are being taken to ensure as much backward compatibility with tools and plugins
that are currently written against Maven 2.0.x.

h1. Affected Plugins

h2. Maven Remote Resources Plugin
* org.apache.maven.project.inheritance.ModelInheritanceAssembler.assembleModelInheritance: used to walk the POMs to find out all the license information. This 
  functionality has been superceded by the model properties-based system for POM construction. We provide the same functionality using the model
  properties-based system but have just placed the component as-is in the maven-compat package to ensure the default lifecycle functions.
